# UDSWB_PCBS

Several PCBs are required in order to manufacture the low-cost urodynamics system. The required file shave been supplied in thi repository.
The system requires one System Controller PCB and two Pressure Sensor PCBs to perform an investigtion.
When manufacturing the system it is best to order 5 System Controller PCBs and 10 Pressure Sensor PCBs (more if there is likely to be a high volume of investigations).

Below are the steps required to order the PCBS.

1. Send the "System Controller PCB\SYSCONTR PCB Gerber" directory to a zipped folder
2. Uploade the zipped folder to a PCB manufacture of your choice (Nb. Check the gerber file using an online viewer, often found on the manufactures website)
3. Place an order for the PCB
4. Repeat these steps for the pressure sensor pcb using the "Pressure Sensor PCB\PSENS PCB Gerber" directory

The KiCad files used to design the PCBs can be found in the "System Controller PCB\KiCad Files" and "Pressure Sensor PCB\KiCad Files" directories.
